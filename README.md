# AI-Ignorance
My journey into AI

## Introduction
This is my daily journal on my journey into AI. I intend to go all the way. My curiosity for AI began when I was reading about quantum computing. Before you begin reading this, please understand that as of today 11/16/2017 (Thursday, 16th of November 2017) I have no knowledge of AI or Quantum Computing except maybe from logically reasoning.

I am knowledgeable in quite a few programming languages I do not have preference for any and I intend to keep it that way till maybe AI forces me to make a choice.

So if you are like me and you are curious about AI please feel free to jump in.

My first read on my journey into AI is on [Hacker Earth](http://blog.hackerearth.com/2015/12/artificial-intelligence-101-how-to-get-started.html)
 I know Python and it is what is recommended but I will go with PHP, for the past two months I have been working with PHP and I currently have a project that requires my PHP attention so I will stick with PHP.
  The first thing I have to learn is HTML and XML Path Language which are quite basic, anyone can cover that in a space of 6-8 hours on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp).
  Then building a bot is the next thing. That also seems like kids stuff, a little tricky but kids stuff
  If you intend to follow along with PHP, you can learn how to create a slack bot [here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/how-to-build-a-slack-bot-using-php.html)
